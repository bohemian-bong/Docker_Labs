Activity 2: In this lab, we will dive more into Dockerfile by creating a Dockerfile such that it builds container with a server running on it.

-------------------- Instructions to be followed ---------------------

1. You have been given a python file for running a Http Flask server named app.py, a file to fill in submission details named file.txt.
2. Create a Dockerfile with appropriate base image of Python such that the app.py is copied into the container and ont running the container the server gets started.
3. While creating the Docker file, select a port on which the server will run on the container.
3. Build the image from the Dockerfile and name the image "my_flask_server".
4. Run the docker container with name "my_server_container".
5. Make sure there is proper port mapping from the host machine to the container. Enter the port number of the hopst machine in file.txt.
7. On requesting the server you will receive a flag. Enter the flag in flie.txt.
8. Evaluate the lab before stopping the container.
9. Stop the container.
