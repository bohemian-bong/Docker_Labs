Activity 1: This lab will provide tou with an introduction to Dockerfile, a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image.

--------------------Instructions to be followed-----------------------

1. Create a Dockerfile such that it produces an image with git installed.
2. Build the Dockerfile, with the name alpine-git.
3. Tag your image as labs-git-v1. Tagging helps in identifying and tracking different versions and variations of a Docker image.
4. Run the container created and go for evaluation while the container is running.
5. Stop the running container.
