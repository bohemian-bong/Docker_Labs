Lab 1: Introduction to Docker Images and Docker Commands

Let's start this lab by running the most basic Docker image:

docker run hello-world

Other basic Docker commands that may be useful for further processes are given as follows. Try them out:

1. docker images
   In order to have a view of all the available docker images.

2. docker ps
   In order to display all the running docker containers. Please note that there are no running conatainers at present because the hello-world container gets executed once and exits immediately.

3. docker inspect <imagename>  	       or     docker inspect <imageid>
   In order to inspect or the know the details of a specific Docker image.

Exercises to be completed before evaluation:
1. Run the hello-world image on the terminal
