Activity 2: In this lab, you are going to learn how to restart an exited container and access its terminal.

--------------------Instructions to be followed---------------------

1. Check the images present currently on the system.
2. If you don't have the Ubuntu image already downloaded, pull it from Docker Hub.
3. Once the ubuntu image is downloaded, check for all exittedcontainers and restart the container named "my_ubuntu_container".
4. This will give you access to the terminal of the container.
5. Write a script named "script.sh" which outputs the conatiner id.
6. Evaluate the lab before exiting the process
7. Exit the terminal.
